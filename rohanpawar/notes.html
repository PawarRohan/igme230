            <h2>Goals and audiences</h2>
            <p>One audience is potential employers. Explaining my process as well as showing my skills is going to be important when looking for internships and jobs. I want a place to display my experience and final projects that is easily digestible and understandable.</p>
            <p>Another audience is peers and professors. Showing my work to my peers is a good way of getting feedback and sharing what Iâ€™m up to. The same goes for professors. Getting feedback from them is invaluable, so it should be easy for them to navigate the page when they help me out. </p>
            <p>One other audience is potential customers. Freelance work can come through the avenue of traffic from my website. People who are considering hiring me for freelance work should be able to see my most impressive projects as well as understand how I think when approaching creative projects. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Design challenges</h2>
            <p>I used a clear, clean design. I wanted to only display a few pieces of information and let the projects themselves be the only defining color in the website. That required strong typography, which is why I chose to have such bold, large project headlines. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Above the call</h2>
            <p>Instead of finding a bit of javascript online to figure out how to make a dropdown menu, I tried to achieve the same effect from scratch. First, I tried to use :focus or :active tags in CSS to trigger the changes I wanted. Then, I used javascript to get a working dropdown menu. It was a challenge, but gratifying in the end. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What changed</h2>
            <p>I added interactive hover states to several links in the homepage, as well as a few on project pages to enhance the activity of viewing the site. They include titles and information. I reworked the home page to be organize with CSS grid instead of flexbox, as well as added a responsive 4th project page.</p>
